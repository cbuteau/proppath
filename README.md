Resolve dot notation path into a sub object.

# Concept

I first wrote this code in a testing framework and it was so nice and simple I thought I could test it and package it.

I don't beleive it should be used in a production environment.

I believe in tests it could useful it abstracting things to configration data.

Example...look up this child object and spy on this method.
